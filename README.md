# Well Known URI Registration Requests

This repository's issues list manages requests to add and change entries in the [well-known URI IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/). Please note our [contribution terms](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Your [Expert](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.6) is currently [@mnot](https://github.com/mnot).

To request registration of a new well-known URI (or a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/protocol-registries/well-known-uris/issues/new/choose) (preferred), or
* Send e-mail to [the mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wellknown-uri-review).

See [RFC8615](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) for more information about well-known URIs; in particular, the [requirements for registration](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615#section-3.1).

Once approved, your request will be incorporated into the IANA registry, whereupon it will be officially registered.
